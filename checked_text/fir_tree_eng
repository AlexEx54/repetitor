Out in the woods stood a nice little Fir Tree. The place he had was a very good one: the sun shone on him, as to fresh air, there was enough of that. And round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as firs. But the little Fir wanted so very much to be a grown-up tree.

He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air. He did not care for the little cottage children. That ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild-strawberries. Theу often came with a whole pitcher full of berries, and sat down near the young tree and said. “What a nice little fir!". But this was what the Tree could not bear to hear.

At the end of a year he had shot up a good deal, and after another year he was another long bit taller. For with fir trees one can always tell by the shoots how many years old they are.
